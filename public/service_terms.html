            <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>Terms of Service Welcome to CatSitter! These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the
                “Terms”) between you and CatSitter! (“CatSitter!,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of CatSitter! applications,
                websites, contents, products, and/or services (the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you
                agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully. CatSitter! provides an online venue that allows
                pet owners and third-party pet care service providers ("Pet Care Providers") to connect with each other
                using Services made available by CatSitter! Labs Inc. and its parents, subsidiaries, representatives,
                affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, “CatSitter!”). CatSitter! has no control over the conduct of Pet
                Care Providers, or any other users of the Services. Please be advised: These Terms contain provisions
                that govern how claims that you and CatSitter! have against each other can be brought (see below). These
                provisions will, with limited exception, require that you submit claims you have against CatSitter! to binding
                and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, group or
                representative action or proceeding. CatSitter! may amend the Terms and modify or update the Services from
                time to time. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes are posted here will constitute
                your acceptance of the amended Terms. By agreeing to these Terms, you expressly acknowledge that you
                understand the Terms (including the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions contained herein) and
                accept all of them. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you may not use or access the
                Services. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years
                old and legally entitled to enter these Terms, and that you have the authority and capacity to enter
                into and abide by these Terms. You further agree and warrant that: Your Information. All information
                that you provide to CatSitter! or through the Services is true and accurate, and you will maintain that
                information up-to-date. You will provide us with whatever proof of identity we may reasonably request.
                You will keep secure and confidential your account password or any identification we provide you which
                allows access to the Services. Account Circumvention. You will not use the Services to identify pet
                owners or Pet Care Providers to complete offline transactions that circumvent your payment obligations
                for the Services. You may not authorize others to use your user status, and you may not assign or
                otherwise transfer your user account to any other person or entity. Legal Compliance. You will comply
                with all applicable state, federal, and local laws while using the Services. You will not copy or
                distribute the Services without written permission from CatSitter!. Access and Use. You may only access the
                Services using authorized means. You will not use the Services for any fraudulent purposes or to cause
                nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience. It is your responsibility to ensure you have the correct software
                and equipment for use with the Services. You will only use an access point or data account that you are
                authorized to use. CatSitter! reserves the right to terminate your use of the Services if you use an
                incompatible or unauthorized device. Protection of Services and Users. You will not: Create Internet
                "links" to the Services or "frame" or "mirror" any software on any other server or wireless or
                Internet-based device. Reverse engineer or access the Services (except as permitted by applicable law)
                in order to, build a competitive product or service, build a product using similar ideas, features,
                functions or graphics of the Services, or copy any ideas, features, functions or graphics of the
                Services. Launch an automated program or script, including, but not limited to, web spiders, web
                crawlers, web robots, web ants, web indexers, bots, viruses or worms, or any program which may make
                multiple server requests per second, or unduly burdens or hinders the operation and/or performance of
                the Services. Send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of applicable laws
                through the Services. Send or store through or on the Services infringing, obscene, threatening,
                libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, including material harmful to children or in
                violation of third party privacy rights. Send or store through or on the Services material containing
                software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or
                programs. Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services or the data contained
                therein. Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related systems or networks. Try to
                harm the Services in any way. LICENSE GRANT Subject to your compliance with these Terms, CatSitter! grants you
                a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Services solely for
                your own personal, non-commercial purposes. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by CatSitter!
                and its licensors. PET OWNER OBLIGATIONS Pet owners warrant and agree that: (1) your pets are free from
                fleas, ticks, and other pests; and (2) you will have your pets fully vaccinated and up to date on all
                forms of preventative medicine prior to receiving services from a Pet Care Provider. PAYMENT TERMS You
                understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services you receive from a Pet
                Care Provider. After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Services, CatSitter!
                will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the Pet Care Provider, as such Pet
                Care Provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of such charges in such manner shall be
                considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Pet Care Provider. Charges will be inclusive
                of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless
                otherwise determined by CatSitter!. You retain the right to request lower charges from a Pet Care Provider for
                services received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods.
                CatSitter! will respond accordingly to any request from a Pet Care Provider to modify charges for a particular
                service. All charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by CatSitter! using the preferred
                payment method designated in your CatSitter! account, after which CatSitter! will send you a receipt by email. If
                your primary payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged,
                you agree that CatSitter! may, as the Pet Care Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary
                payment method in your account, if available. As between you and CatSitter!, CatSitter! reserves the right to
                establish, remove and/or revise charges for any or all services obtained through the use of the Services
                at any time in CatSitter!’s sole discretion. CatSitter! will use reasonable efforts to inform you of charges that
                may apply, provided that you will be responsible for charges incurred under your CatSitter! account regardless
                of your awareness of such charges or the amounts thereof. CatSitter! may from time to time provide certain
                users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or
                similar services obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers
                and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or
                the charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Pet Care Provider
                at any time prior to such Pet Care Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation
                fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Pet Care Provider for the services
                provided. CatSitter! does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Pet Care
                Provider. Any representation by CatSitter! to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or
                "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that CatSitter!
                provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Pet Care Provider. You understand
                and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Pet Care Provider
                who provides you with services obtained through the Services, you are under no obligation to do so.
                Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Services, you
                will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Pet Care
                Provider.
